# NOTES - CR 2

### React
	- AWESOME TESTS! How did TDD Feel?
	- Test thunks using `thunk.withextraargument`
	- Awesome use of Dumb Components and Connect()
	- Google Auth broken on FE
	- No nesting of routes
	- Ordering flow incomplete on MVP 
	- Whence JQuery?

### Redux
	- Logging Middleware + Browser Extensions in DEV only
	- CRUD actions for reviews/orders? Which are necessary?

### Workflow
	- Great Readme
	- No more direct commits to master (merges only)
	- Imbalanced commit ratio 
	- Good User stories... Wireframes too? 
	- Semantic commit messages:

	   - the type of commit (feature, test, fix, style, refactor, etc.)
	   - the subject of the committed code
	   - a present-tense description of what the commited code does

### Deployment
	- NODE_ENV defaults to production, so specify development (which you've been doing)
	- Webpack is in dev dependencies, and we see no build process in postinstall or otherwise... Not wrong, just want to discuss)
	- export NODE_ENV declarations

### Discussion
	- How will we architect new features?
